# Reading Notes - Wednesday June 8, 2022

Welcome to your second reading notes file! Reading notes are important because they will help you reinforce what you have learned and help you master the syntax of markdown (which is what I'm writing for you here :D )! The following questions will be for you to answer from the reading and give you a chance to add any thoughts or comments on what you have learned. The more you write, the more you can interpret the concepts you learn ;)


HTML:
(Answers *MUST* be formatted as unordered list)

1. **What are 3 examples of HTML lists? How are they formatted?**
	- Ordered list, numbered lists
	- Unordered list, bullet points
	- Description list, indents each <dd> under a description term


CSS:
(Answers *MUST* be formatted as unordered list)

1. **What is the box model in your own words?**
	- wrapping content in divs or something similar, wraps around html content and makes it look nice

2. **What properties make up the box model?**
	- padding
	- margins
	- borders
	- content being wrapped inside

3. **What are 2 types of ways to display an element in CSS?**
	- block
	- inline

4. **What is the difference between inline elements and block elements?**
	- block elements always start on its own line and takes up full width of the space
	- inline elements only take up the space asked

Javascript:
(Answers *MUST* be formatted as unordered list)

1. **What are conditionals in your own words?**
	- used to test if code is true or false

2. **How do you write a conditional in Javascript?**
	- if (condition to be tested){
		code to run if condition is true;
	}else{
		code to run if condition is false;
	}

3. **What are 3 examples of comparision operators?**
	- booleans true/false
	- strictly not equal !==
	- greater than >

4. **What is the break keyword in Javascript?**
	- it breaks you out of code being run, for example, when you're using switch statements. It's how you get the code to end so it doesn't run forever.

5. **What is a for loop in JS? How does it contrast a while loop?**
	- for (initializer; condition; final expression){
		code to run;
	}
	- while (this condition is always true){
		run this code;
	}
	- for loops are helpful when iterating through arrays/objects, it sets out all its conditions in the beginning
	- while loops continute to check if the conditions given are true, and run the code until it comes back false
