*Welcome to your fourth and LAST reading notes file of the week! Reading notes are important because they will help you reinforce what you have learned and help you master the syntax of markdown (which is what I'm writing for you here :D )! The following questions will be for you to answer from the reading and give you a chance to add any thoughts or comments on what you have learned. The more you write, the more you can interpret the concepts you learn* ;)


## HTML:
(Answers *MUST* be formatted as unordered list)

1. What is a real world use case for the `alt` attribute being used in a website?
    -alternate text for in case you image file doesn't show up, the viewer still knows what was supposed to be there
    -improved accessibility for visually impaired folks
2. How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?
    -alt text
3. Provide an example of when the `figure` element would be useful in an HTML document.
    -further improved accessibility. If you have an image on your page, of course put the alt with the image tag, but wrapping it all in a figure tag with a fig caption lets screen readers know that there's extra important info along with the image
4. Describe the difference between a `gif` image and an `svg` image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.
    -a gif image is made up of a bunch of mini different colored dots like a puzzle and when you zoom out, it's a picture. MOstly used for animated images
    -a svg is also an image, but instead of different colored dots working together, you're manipulating the size of shapes to create images. It's more technical and more complicated, but zoomed in, you can't see the dots that you'd see with gif images
5. What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?
    -png, more precise reproduction of source images
    -["more precise reproduction of source images"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types#choosing_an_image_format)

--------------------------------


## CSS:
(Answers *MUST* be formatted as unordered list)


1. Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.
    -background colors are what we see behind the content, like behind the text.
    -foreground colors would be like text color
2. Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up.  How would you use color to give his blog some character?
    -i'd find the vibe of the site and create a color palete that compliments his content. Then i'd play around with the contrasting colors in that scheme to adjust background color of the site as well as color of text/different sections of the page to draw the user's eyes to certain elements
3. What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?
    -accessibility and ease of access. Making it not difficult for the user to view the contnent
    -backup fonts in case the user's device cannot view a certain font
4. What do `font-size`, `font-weight`, and `font-style` do to HTML text elements?
    -font-size: how bit or small the text is
    -font-weight: how bold the text is
    -font-style: can set text to italic, etc.
5. Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an `h1` element.
    -letter-spacing
    -word-spacing




## Any thoughts / comments you would like to add?
-Everthing is so particular/specific. Coding and is definitely making me think more before I act, so I love that.
